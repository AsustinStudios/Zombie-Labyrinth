Zombie-Labyrinth
================

Zombie Labyrinth is a 2D TPS (Third Person Shooter) with a perspective similar to the one found on a Pokemon or Zelda game for Game Boy. It's about a software programmer (you can play with multiple characters) that is working on the central office of a bank (BBUVA) in Mexico City, when the Zombie apocalipsis begins. He must hack his way through BBUVA corporate office and fight against countles zombies, bank employees and bank bureaucracy in order to get out alive.

Zombie Labyrinth aims to bring the epicness and awesomness of Metal Slug and merge it with the 15th generation Hi-Def graphics of games like Pokemon Silver Version; or the never aging The Legend of Zelda, the original 1986 release.

Zombie Labyrinth is where futuristic gameplay meets state of the art technology.
