# Zombie-Labyrinth

Zombie Labyrinth is a 2D TPS (Third Person Shooter) with a perspective similar to the one found on a Pokemon or Zelda game for Game Boy. It's about a software programmer (you can play with multiple characters) that is working on the central office of a bank (BBUVA) in Mexico City, when the Zombie apocalipsis begins. He must hack his way through BBUVA corporate office and fight against countles zombies, bank employees and bank bureaucracy in order to get out alive.

Zombie Labyrinth aims to bring the epicness and awesomness of Metal Slug and merge it with the 15th generation Hi-Def graphics of games like Pokemon Silver Version; or the never aging The Legend of Zelda, the original 1986 release.

Zombie Labyrinth is where futuristic gameplay meets state of the art technology.

## Playing &Testing the Game
Zombie Labyrinth is supoused to support Linux, Windows and OSX, however at this point I do the development on Linux (amd64) and I haven't tested it in any other platform or architecture. It's easy to test the game, just follow this steps:

1. Start by [downloading the code](https://github.com/AsustinStudios/Zombie-Labyrinth/archive/master.zip) or cloning the git repo: `git clone git@github.com:AsustinStudios/Zombie-Labyrinth.git`.
2. Install [Python 2.7](http://www.python.org/download) and the [Pygame](http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml) version corresponding to your OS and Python version. On most debian-based Linux just do `sudo apt-get install python-pygame`.
3. Make sure you know how to call python from the command line.
4. Enter the project directory and run python `src/main.py`.
5. Play the game! :D
..* Use `WASD` to move around, left-click for melee attack & righ-click to shoot.
..* `ESC` to exit the game
